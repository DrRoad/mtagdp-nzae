# Modelling TA GDP

## The Challenge

- Consistent with National and Regional Tier 1 GDP
- Detailed data available for re-use
- Source code and method open for critique and improvement
- Easy interactive access

## The data

- Business Demography Statistics
- Linked Employer - Employee Database
- RGDP and NGDP

## The method (bottom up)

- reconcile the various earnings measures
- scale up employee numbers to earnings
- scale up earnings to GDP

## The method (alternative, top down version)

- reconcile the two GDP measures
- allocate any ambiguity on basis of earnings
- allocate any remaining ambiguity on basis of employees

## Commuter correction {data-transition="fade-out"}

- earnings only published by place of residence
- use the Census 2013 to reallocate earnings on basis of commuting
- known area for future improvement

## Key assumptions

- Earnings a good indicator of value added
- Employee numbers a good indicator earnings
- No interaction between TA and earnings:GDP ratio for specified industry
- No interation between Region/TA and inter-industry relative earnings:GDP ratios  of industries
- Commuter patterns unchanging and not industry-specific
- Price movements not industry-specific
