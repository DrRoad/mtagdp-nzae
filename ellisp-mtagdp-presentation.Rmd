# Modelling TA GDP

## The Challenge

- Consistent with National and Regional Tier 1 GDP
- Detailed data available for re-use
- Source code and method open for critique and improvement
- Easy interactive access

## The data

- Business Demography Statistics
- Linked Employer - Employee Database
- RGDP and NGDP

## The method (bottom up)

- reconcile the various earnings measures
- scale up employee numbers to earnings
- scale up earnings to GDP

## The method (alternative, top down version)

- reconcile the two GDP measures
- allocate any ambiguity on basis of earnings
- allocate any remaining ambiguity on basis of employees
