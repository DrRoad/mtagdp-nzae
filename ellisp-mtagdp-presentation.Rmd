# Modelling TA GDP

## The Challenge

- Consistent with National and Regional Tier 1 GDP
- Detailed data available for re-use
- Source code and method open for critique and improvement
- Easy interactive access

## The data

- Business Demography Statistics
- Linked Employer - Employee Database
- Regional GDP
- National GDP

## The method (bottom up)

- reconcile the various earnings measures
- scale up employee numbers to earnings
- scale up earnings to GDP

## The method (alternative, top down version)

- reconcile the two GDP measures
- allocate any ambiguity on basis of earnings
- allocate any remaining ambiguity on basis of employees

## Commuter correction {data-transition="fade-out"}

- earnings only published by place of residence
- use the Census 2013 to reallocate earnings on basis of commuting
- known area for future improvement

## {data-background="figures/commuting.svg"}


## Assumptions

- Earnings a good indicator of value added
- Employee numbers a good indicator of earnings
- No interaction between TA and earnings:GDP ratio for specified industry
- No interation between Region/TA and inter-industry relative earnings:GDP ratios  of industries
- Commuter patterns unchanging and not industry-specific
- Price movements not industry-specific
- Price movements not region-specific

## Question

Do either of this variables in 2005 have an impact on the next ten years of growth:

* Agricultural importance
* GDP per capita

## Modelling approach

- Generalized additive model
- Degrees of freedom allocated to variables based on strength of Spearman $\rho^2$
- Smoothed two dimensional spline to control for spatial correlation

## Strength of relationships

##
$$
GDPGrowth_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times PropAg2005 +\\ \beta_2 \times GDPpp2005 + \beta_3 \times s(lat, long, 5) + \epsilon_i$$

- no evidence of an agriculture in 2005 effect
- no evidence of a GDP per capita in 2005 effect
- strong spatial effect

## The spatial effect
